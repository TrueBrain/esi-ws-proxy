            <h1>ESI WebSocket</h1>
            <div>
                One of my (SmallBrain / TrueBrain) main problems with ESI is the complexity to get going.
                Often I find myself wanting to write a small application that monitors one of my wallets, or my skills, or my location.
                But then I have to deal with ESI, and the "this should take an hour" explodes into a multi-day effort.
                And every developer is doing that over and over and over again.
            </div>
            <div>
                It is not that something is actually wrong with ESI, but it is not written for the small developer.
                There are so many things to consider: how often to poll, how to combine multi-page results, how to deal with cached pages (and multi-page results with different cache-times), dealing with errors, etc etc.
            </div>
            <div>
                So for a while now I have been wondering: how would an easier-to-use interface look like.
                And there are two trains of thought here: a better REST interface, and a WebSocket interface.
                This page is a small test for the latter.
            </div>
            <div>
                How it works:
                <ul>
                    <li>You create a WebSocket request to this <span>/ws</span> endpoint.</li>
                    <li>You send a JSON message, which are actually RPC commands, to the server.</li>
                    <li>The server takes care of all the complexity, and only returns to you what you were looking for.</li>
                </ul>
                For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>I authenticate with a token <span>{"authenticate": {"token": "..."}}</span>.</li>
                    <li>I ask for my character ID <span>{"character": {"get_id": {}}}</span>.</li>
                    <li>I subscribe to my location <span>{"location": {"subscribe": {}}}</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                From the server I receive messages containing the content of my request.
                For example the character ID, or a constant stream of location updates.
                It is very important to realise here: I do not constant get an update of the same location.
                I only get notified when the location changes.
                It is a subscription, not a "poll every 5 seconds".
            </div>
            <div>
                <a href="/demo.html">Test this out yourself!</a>
            </div>
            <div>
                In my mind, this vastly simplifies how to deal with ESI.
                If I would to implement this on a wallet, you would just subscribe to a wallet, and you get messages when new transactions arrive.
                No need to deal with any of the other ESI stuff; you just get a message when something happens.
                In other words: event-driven.
            </div>
            <div>
                This has many other advantages.
                Just thinking about the waste of bandwidth created by the current ESI is insane.
                There are enough tools out there that poll location of characters every 5 seconds, only to find out that the location has not changed.
                Such a waste.
                And in most of these cases, you are actually only interested in the change; not the current state.
            </div>
            <div>
                And before you wonder: but how about the server resources for all these open websockets?
                Did you know that a single websocket consumes about as much resources as a single HTTP request?
                So that if you request the location of a user 12 times a minute, that is far more taxing on a server than a single websockets?
                <br>
                The reason why is simple: every HTTP request sends back and forth an insane amount of HTTP headers.
                A websocket connection only does it once.
                And here I assume the TCP+TLS connection is actually reused.
                As setting up a TCP+TLS connection on its own is already expensive.
                <br>
                And these days we can even compress websocket channels on HTTP level, meaning they consume so little bandwidth ... and keeping a websocket alive consumes such little resource ...
            </div>
            <div>
                Another note: this might not work for every ESI endpoint.
                Only endpoints that are most commonly used in an event-driven way are good candidates.
                It is also not meant to replace current ESI endpoints, but to complement them.
                <br>
                For example, the wallet endpoint is a perfect candidate for this.
                As only the first time you actually want to know what is on the wallet, but after that you just want to receive mutations.
                Similar for assets, fleet location, etc.
            </div>
            <div>
                And this all started just because I wanted to get a notification on Discord with the profit per hour for incursions I was doing.
            </div>
            <div>
                So what now?
                This page is just a proof-of-concept, to see what others thing and to collect input.
                <br>
                Ideally this of course would run on ESI.
                And in an even better world, it would directly interact with EVE Online itself, meaning that when your location changes, you get notified instantly.
                As with wallet transactions, etc.
                In other words: it would do away with those pesky cache-times the current ESI endpoints have.
